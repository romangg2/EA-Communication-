  **Addition Information needed for Eric & Barry, besides what is outlined in the GH Templates:**
    
   <b>Eric</b>:
  - Needs Paper Doc with why is he involved in the interview panel / what other interviewers thought / what he needs to focus on / Schedule for Onsites
  - Eric will decline interview if not provided with this information. 
  
  <b>Barry</b>:
  - Add a line that says “Barry to call Name” in the subject after the general populated subject line and in the body of the calendar note section.
  - Please make sure to add Brenna to the invite as well.

**In-Person Onsite**: If the executive is meeting the candidate in-person, please make sure to **REMOVE** the **HANGOUT LINK** from the invite. This will avoid confusion for executives who might think it’s a phone/hangouts interview.
